 * Match — one-card-at-a-time deck (Discover) + a grid (Browse) + real

 * (SwipeFeature -> HingeStyleCard, real server-authoritative swipe/match via

 * involved pass: HingeStyleCard almost certainly owns its own pointer-based
 * drag gesture for the swipe motion, and HoloCard also tracks pointer events
 * for its tilt effect on the same element -- wrapping one in the other needs
 * that gesture code read first to confirm they don't fight over the same
 * pointer events, not a blind wrap. See STUDIO_REFERENCE_SURFACE_AUDIT.md.
