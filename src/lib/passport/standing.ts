/**
 * Standing — the Passport level-up system.
 *
 * The ONE canonical level system. Replaces the retired tier/XP shims.
 * Tells creators exactly what their next high-leverage move is.
 *
 * Inputs (all real moat signals — no daily-login padding):
 *  - verified credits (capped recency bonus)
 *  - co-signs received (heaviest weight, capped at 10 unique)
 *  - profile completion (small contribution, prevents profile-padding)
 *  - recent activity (gigs / studios / collabs in last 90 days)
 *  - reply SLA (<24h bonus)
 *  - lastActivityAt → score decay if dormant 180d+
 *  - verificationScore → gates L3+ (Verified Pro and above)
 *
 * Pure function. No DB writes.
