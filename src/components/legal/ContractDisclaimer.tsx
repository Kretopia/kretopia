          ThriveIN is not a law firm. Our contracts are written agreements between you and the other party.
          They're enforceable as private contracts in most jurisdictions, but specific clauses
          (taxes, IP, dispute resolution, consumer protection) vary by country. For deals over a few thousand
          dollars or anything cross-border, have a licensed attorney in your country review it.
