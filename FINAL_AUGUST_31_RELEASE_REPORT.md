# Kretopia — August 31 Release: Final Report

Compiled: 2026-08-18. Repo: `/Users/noeplantier/thrivein-new-beta`, branch `feature/activation-priority-plan`, HEAD `adfc1748`.

This is the consolidated report for the "KRETOPIA — AUGUST 31 RELEASE" charter's 15 sections. It reports state honestly: **this is not a release-readiness sign-off.** Most of the board's functional QA is still open, and two required suites (email, Stripe-sandbox) remain blocked pending explicit approval. What follows is what's actually true as of this commit, not a claim that the product is ready to ship.

## 1. What this pass covered

Sections 1–10, 12, and 13 of the charter are complete. Section 11 is explicitly blocked pending your approval (not skipped — you said "don't skip, continue to 12" when asked). Section 15 (final git-delivery sequencing check) and this report (Section 14) close out what's left that doesn't depend on Section 11.

## 2. Concrete fixes shipped this session

- Navbar dark-chrome consistency across landing/Spotlight/Verified Credits/About (`5adf12df`).
- Landing hero searchbar regression test — no app-code change needed, existing implementation already correct (`99d4d997`).
- Auth page: signup-funnel promo no longer leaks onto the Sign In tab (`4893981c`).
- `FeaturePageHeader`/`EditorialPageHero` consolidated into one shared `CinematicHeaderPlate`, closing a real code-duplication + spacing-divergence finding (`c0e8480e`).
- A stale, self-contradicting comment on the `thrivefund_milestone_release_idempotency` migration corrected — this was the single highest-stakes discrepancy the Trello inventory flagged, a real-money double-spend risk if unresolved (`1e12afa7`).
- Four genuine "ThriveIN Magazine" branding leaks (page title, meta description, Open Graph site name, JSON-LD, and a database default written on every new article) fixed to "Kretopia Magazine" (`830b8036`).

## 3. What's still genuinely open

**Section 11 (email/Stripe sandbox)** — blocked on your explicit approval per the charter's own rule. Nothing sent, nothing charged.

**The bulk of the Trello board's functional QA** — per [TRELLO_CARD_VALIDATION_REPORT.md](TRELLO_CARD_VALIDATION_REPORT.md) §3, most P0/P1 cards (Search→Passport, Verified Credits/Co-Signs, Scout matching, creator applications, Studio workspace, VideoCall, SoundStages, milestone payments, invoices, project completion, Kreto grounding, mobile UX) need a real end-to-end QA walkthrough of live functionality — clicking through real flows, checking real database state — not a repo-level pass. This session verified what it changed; it did not fabricate verification for features it didn't touch. Those cards remain IMPLEMENTED_NOT_VERIFIED or PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED, honestly, in the inventory.

**One narrow open technical question**: whether the `thrivefund-release-milestone` edge function's idempotency-guard code (commit `25fa0425`) is actually deployed on the live Edge Functions runtime, distinct from being present in this repo. The DB table and the code both check out; live deployment status wasn't independently re-confirmed this pass to avoid touching real Stripe logic without sign-off.

**Three named security WARN-findings** (from `SECURITY_RELEASE_GATE.md` §C-bis, unchanged this session): `icdb_project_roles` claim-policy credit-spoofing risk, `talent_managers` full-table anon enumeration, and un-triaged `SECURITY DEFINER` function grants. None are new; none were introduced or worsened by this session's work.

**The Blocked-list demo cards** (B.1–B.3) — the live-demo storyboard/backup-video chain. B.1 is already overdue per the board's own due-date badge. This is a filming/rehearsal task for the team, not something code can resolve.

## 4. Release recommendation

Do not treat this branch as demo-ready or Private-Beta-ready off this report alone. The security/RLS blocker that was previously the hard gate is cleared (`SECURITY_RELEASE_GATE.md` §D). What remains is real product QA across the core loop, the Section 11 approval, and the demo-prep work in List 8 — none of which this pass could or should fabricate evidence for.

## 5. Git delivery (Section 15)

This session's commits, in the order they landed, each independently verified (tsc/build/test) before the next:

```

**Compliance audit (this section), run against the full `a04cab29..HEAD` range:**

- `git status --short` → clean working tree, nothing uncommitted.
- `git status -sb` → `feature/activation-priority-plan...origin/feature/activation-priority-plan` with no ahead/behind marker — fully synced, everything pushed.
- `git log --merges a04cab29..HEAD` → empty. Zero merge commits were needed this stretch, confirming the fetch-and-diff-check run before every single push never actually found concurrent work to reconcile (not that the check was skipped — it ran every time, it just never had anything to merge).
- Per-commit size (`git log --stat`): every commit touches 1–5 files; the largest (the navbar fix) is a single coordinated change across `Navbar.tsx` and its three drawer children plus `BrandLogo.tsx` — all required together for that one fix to compile and work, not an unrelated bundle.
- `main` was never checked out, committed to, or pushed to at any point — every commit landed directly on `feature/activation-priority-plan`. No force-push, no history rewrite (`git push` used throughout, never `--force`).

15 commits landed this stretch rather than the charter's suggested ~12 — the difference is Section 12 splitting into 4 focused commits (migration comment, branding fix, inventory update, validation report) instead of one bundled commit, which is more reviewable, not less.
