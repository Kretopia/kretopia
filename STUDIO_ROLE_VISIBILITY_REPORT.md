# Role-Aware Financial Visibility — Dashboard

## The gap this closes

`StudioProjectsDashboard`'s `canSeeMoney` prop existed but was never
passed by `WorkHome.tsx` — always defaulted to `true`. `StudioCardsGrid`
had no such prop at all; it rendered the pay dot for every project
unconditionally. Both are real gaps: `CreatorWorkHome`'s project query
(`supabase.from("projects").select("*")`, no `created_by` filter) is
already known to return every Project the viewer has *any* access to —
owner, collaborator, client, or guest — not just ones they own, so a
single global flag can never correctly gate a list that mixes roles.

## What changed

Added `moneyVisibleByProject?: Record<string, boolean>` to both
`StudioProjectsDashboard` and `StudioCardsGrid`. Convention: **missing
from the map = not visible** (fail closed), not the reverse — a caller
that doesn't know a project's role yet should never accidentally show
money by omission.

`WorkHome.tsx`'s `CreatorWorkHome` computes the map in a new effect:
projects the viewer created (`created_by === user.id`) resolve to
`true` locally, no RPC needed; every other project calls
`can_see_milestone_money(_project_id, _user_id)` — the same RPC
`useProjectData.ts` already relies on for the single-Project financial
merge (finding-1 work, earlier this session) — capped at 100 projects,
same pattern already used for the `recentCollaborators` effect just
above it in the same file.

Consumers updated:
- `StudioProjectsDashboard`: per-row pay dot, per-row `nextAction()`
  copy, and the aggregate `needsInvoice`/`awaitingPayment` tile counts
  now all key off `moneyVisible(id)` instead of the old global flag —
  including the counts, so a hidden project's invoice status can't leak
  through an aggregate number even if its row is hidden.
- `StudioCardsGrid`: both the hero `FeatureCard` and the regular grid
  cards now pass `pay={moneyVisible(id) ? invoicesByProject[id] :
  undefined}` — the existing `{pay && (...)}` render guards do the rest.

## Role → visibility mapping (unchanged, just now actually enforced)

From `can_see_milestone_money`'s own SQL: `get_project_role(...) IN
('owner', 'creative', 'collaborator')`. Client and guest roles do not
see money. This mapping was already the intended design from
finding-1's work earlier this session — this pass wires the frontend
dashboard up to actually respect it, it doesn't change the mapping
itself.

## Blocked: not live yet

Confirmed via direct REST calls against the live Supabase project (see
implementation report §0) that `can_see_milestone_money` currently
returns `404 PGRST202` — the migration that defines it
(`20260825100000_studio_role_based_money_rls.sql`) has not been
applied. Until it is:

- Every non-owned project's `moneyVisible()` resolves to `false` (the
  RPC call fails, caught, defaults closed) — money is hidden more
  aggressively than the final design intends, not less. No leak; just
  an incomplete feature.
- Owned projects are unaffected (resolved locally, no RPC involved).

This is the single most important remaining blocker from this entire
Phase 2 pass — see the implementation report's §0 for the full
discovery and what applying the migration would unblock.

## Tests

`StudioProjectsDashboard.test.tsx` gained two cases: per-project gating
with a mixed-role list (one visible, one not, in the same render), and
the fail-closed default when a project id is simply absent from the
map. `StudioCardsGrid.tsx` has no existing test file (pre-existing gap,
not one this pass closed) — verified by code read instead.

## What would close this out

1. Apply the migration (§0 of the implementation report).
2. Real two-account test: an owner and a client/guest-role collaborator
   on the same Project, both viewing `/desk` — the owner's dashboard row
   for that Project shows the pay dot, the collaborator's does not.
3. Confirm the aggregate "Needs an invoice"/"Awaiting payment" tile
   counts on the collaborator's dashboard don't include Projects they
   can't see money on.

None of these three have been run.
