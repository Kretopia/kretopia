## 🐛 Sentry Error Monitoring

- Sign up for free (generous free tier)
- Create a new project

#### 2. Get Your DSN
- After creating the project, Sentry will show you a DSN
- It looks like: `https://xxx@xxx.ingest.sentry.io/xxx`
- Copy this DSN

#### 3. Add DSN to Environment
In your Lovable project settings, add:
```
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=your-dsn-here
```

Once deployed with the DSN, Sentry will start capturing:
- ✅ Runtime errors
- ✅ Unhandled promise rejections  
- ✅ Console errors
