## 🚀 RECOMMENDATION

**Launch Decision:** GO FOR BETA ✅

**Reasoning:**
1. All critical blocking issues resolved
2. Core user flow works reliably (sign up → onboarding → discover → match)
3. Performance is acceptable (3-5s page loads)
4. Empty states prevent confusion
5. Error recovery mechanisms in place

**Beta Test Plan:**
1. Soft launch to 50 users first
2. Monitor console logs and errors
3. Track activation and retention metrics
4. Gather feedback on remaining friction
5. Iterate quickly based on data
6. Scale to 200+ users after 1 week if metrics good

**Success Criteria for Scale:**
- >40% sign up to onboarding completion
- >30% onboarding to first action
- >20% Day 7 retention
- <10% error rate
