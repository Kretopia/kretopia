# Passport + Studio Rearchitecture — Before-State Audit

Baseline: `tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm run build` succeeds, `eslint .` at the established pre-existing baseline (3188 errors / 310 warnings — accepted debt, not chased, unchanged from prior phases this session). No `typecheck` or test script exists in `package.json` (`dev`, `build`, `build:dev`, `lint`, `preview` only) — `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.app.json` is used as the typecheck equivalent throughout this branch's history, and there is no unit-test suite to run.

## 1. Current component tree — Passport (`/profile`, `src/pages/Profile.tsx`)

Non-company render order (company accounts get a fully separate tree via `CompanyProfileView`, out of scope here):

1. `ClaimedProfileGlow` — ambient FX overlay
2. Inline "Passport" eyebrow header
3. Inline reveal banner (conditional)
4. `PassportKretoEntry`
5. `ClaimContinueBanner`
6. `DiscoveriesInbox` (conditional)
7. **`ProfileHero`** — image, name, **bio**, stats — hero #1
8. **`PassportClaimHero`** (wraps `HoloCard`) — the 3D Passport ID card — hero #2
9. `LevelUpCard`
10. `PassportMomentum`
11. `ThriveRemembersChip`
12. `RecentlyWorkedWith` (conditional)
13. `PassportCommandCenter`
14. Inline "Preview public Passport" / "Private dashboard" links
15. `ProfileContentSections` — tabbed container: Stamps / Book Me / Skills / Co-signs
16. `KretoPassportBuilder` (modal)
17. `ProfileDialogs` (dialog bundle — includes `PassportShareSheet`)
18. `EPKPdfEditor` (modal)

**The "two competing hero sections" problem, confirmed exactly:** `ProfileHero` (item 7, has image/name/bio/stats) and `PassportClaimHero` (item 8, the 3D `HoloCard`-wrapped ID card) are two separate, sequential full-width blocks. Bio lives only in `ProfileHero`; the 3D card does not render it at all. This is Phase 1's primary target.

**Confirmed dead/orphaned (leave on disk, do not delete):** `PassportOverview.tsx` — not mounted anywhere, already known and already unmounted from a prior phase. `PassportShareSheet` is imported in `Profile.tsx` but only actually used inside `ProfileDialogs.tsx` — not literally dead, just redundantly imported.

## 2. The 3D Passport component — `HoloCard.tsx`

Already exists, already good: pure CSS (`perspective`/`rotateX`/`rotateY`, no 3D library dependency), pointer-tracked tilt + foil glare, disabled via `prefers-reduced-motion` check AND `(hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` check (so touch devices never get tilt) — `src/components/passport/HoloCard.tsx:22-26`. This already satisfies the charter's "subtle, performant, reduced-motion-safe, touch-stable" requirements as a shell. **Reused, not rebuilt, in Phase 1.**

Already mounted in three places: `PassportClaimHero` (the Passport ID card), `AchievementCard` (every Stamp/credit card), `CreditVerificationPanel` (every endorsement card). Confirms "Co-Sign Holo 3D cards" from an earlier phase are real and live.

## 3. Bio

Lives in `ProfileHero.tsx:357-362` only, rendered as a plain paragraph, separate from and before the 3D `HoloCard`. Not integrated. **Phase 1 moves it inside the unified card.**

## 4. Stamps

Two separate, inconsistent implementations:
- `CreditsSection.tsx` (Passport's "Stamps" tab) — grid of `AchievementCard`s, HoloCard-wrapped, evidence-gated labeling already correct (`"Verified"` only when `verification_status === "verified"`; otherwise `"Vouched · N"`, `"Publicly Sourced"`, `"Pending"`, or `"Self-claimed"` — **no mislabeling found**).
- `UnifiedWorkHistory.tsx` (`/credits/mine`, a separate route) — grouped vertical list, not HoloCard-wrapped, also evidence-gated correctly.

Terminology is already correct everywhere (Verified Credit vs. Stamp distinction respected). Phase 3's Stamps work is a layout/carousel modernization of `CreditsSection.tsx`, not a terminology fix.

## 5. Book Me

Not a single component — the "Book Me" tab mounts five components together: `HireMeTrustBar`, `AvailabilityCalendarSection`, `BookingWindowsCard`, `RateCardSection`, `WorkWithMeSection`. Between them, availability, rate, booking windows, and a request flow **already exist** — closer to the charter's target than expected. `WorkWithMeSection` (the largest, main content) is a Services/Products marketplace layout (WhatsApp-Business-style), CTA text "Book Now" / "Select · {price}" / "Request", not carousel-based. Phase 3's work here is consolidating five separately-styled blocks into one coherent surface with one dominant CTA, not building booking/availability from scratch.

## 6. Skills

`SkillsSection.tsx` (mounted) uses `{ skill: string; level: number; category: string }` — **no confirmed/AI-suggested/inferred distinction exists at all**, flat list only. A second, incompatible `SkillsVerification.tsx` component exists with a different `Skill` shape and is not mounted on the Passport route — out of scope, not touched.

**Feasibility check (done before committing to a plan):** `profiles.professional_skills` / `profiles.passion_skills` are `Json | null` columns (confirmed via `types.ts:12554,12567`) — free-form, not a fixed Postgres schema. A `source: "confirmed" | "ai_suggested" | "inferred"` field can be added to each skill object **without a migration**. This is what Phase 3 will do.

## 7. Co-Signs — the most important finding of this audit

**Two unrelated systems currently share the "co-sign" name, and they are not the same thing:**

- **`ReviewsSection.tsx`** — literally labeled "Co-signs" in the tab bar, backed by `reviews`/`review_requests` tables, shape is `{ reviewer_name, rating, review_text, project_name, is_endorsed, is_verified, status }` — this is a **star-rating testimonial system** from past collaborators. Plain vertical list, no HoloCard.
- **`CreditVerificationPanel.tsx`** — labeled "Verification Requests" in its own UI (not a tab, always visible above the tabs), backed by `credit_endorsements`, status values `pending/accepted/declined/expired` — this is **evidence-verification for specific credits**, and this is the one with the HoloCard 3D treatment already built.

The charter's requested 4 categories — **Verified / Self-claimed / Pending / Publicly Sourced** — are evidence states of a *credit claim*, not sentiments of a *testimonial*. They map cleanly onto `credits.verification_status` (`verified`/`pending`/unset) plus provenance (`discovered_credits` / auto-import source vs. manually entered) — **not** onto the star-rating `reviews` table.

**Decision, documented here rather than made silently mid-edit:** Phase 3 builds the real 4-category Co-Sign carousel system around **credits + their endorsement/verification state** (extending `CreditVerificationPanel`'s already-built HoloCard cards), and leaves `ReviewsSection` as what it actually is — a testimonials feature — renaming its tab label from the confusing "Co-signs" to something honest (e.g. "Reviews") so the two systems stop colliding under one name. This is a UI/copy change only; no data is touched, no table is renamed, nothing is deleted. Both features keep functioning; they just stop pretending to be the same thing.

## 8. Studio (`/desk` → `WorkHome.tsx`, `/desk/:projectId` → `ThriveDesk.tsx`)

Confirmed already carousel-ized (real `Carousel` primitive + `CarouselPositionDots`): `SoundStagesRail`, `CastingCallsRail`, `RecentRecordingsRail`, plus an inline "Recent collaborators" carousel in `WorkHome.tsx`. **Still a plain CSS grid:** `StudioCardsGrid` — the actual project-room cards, the single biggest visual mass on Studio home. This is Phase 4's primary target: fold `StudioCardsGrid` and the already-carousel-ized rails into one condensed control-room layout instead of "hero grid + four more independent rails stacked below it."

`ThriveDesk.tsx` (single-project workspace) is already a tabbed workspace, not a card wall — lower priority for Phase 4.

## 9. New Room / New Project

**Two parallel, non-unified flows**, both writing to `projects`/`project_tasks` (consistent backend, good):
- `VoiceFirstCreateModal` — Studio home's "New project" button. Header "New room", headline **"What are you making?"** (matches the charter's example verbatim). Voice or text entry → AI extraction → review/edit → create.
- `CreateProjectWizard` (re-exported as `CreateProjectDialog`) — used by the global FAB, the in-room sidebar, and `ProjectsList.tsx`. 3-step form, step 1 is also titled "What are you making?", additionally writes `project_collaborators`. Embeds `VoiceFirstCreateModal` internally as a voice shortcut for its own step 1.

**Neither has draft persistence** — both fully reset state on close (same class of bug fixed in onboarding last phase). **Decision:** Phase 5 enhances `VoiceFirstCreateModal` (the primary Studio-home entry point) with the charter's fuller field set, stronger CTA copy, and draft persistence (matching the sessionStorage pattern already proven in `Onboarding.tsx`), rather than attempting to merge two independently-wired flows with different call sites into one component in this pass — that merge is a larger, separate risk than this charter's timeline supports responsibly. `CreateProjectWizard`'s other entry points are left working as-is.

## 10. Shared Liquid Glass primitives — all confirmed present and exported

`GlassSurface`, `GlassPanel`, `GlassNavbar`, `GlassInput`, `GlassButton`, `GlassDrawer` (+ subcomponents), `GlassModal` (+ subcomponents), `GlassCarousel`/`GlassCarouselItem`, `CarouselPositionDots`, `GlassStatusPill` — all live in `src/components/ui/glass/`, all re-exported from `index.ts`. Reused throughout this charter, not rebuilt.

## 11. Navigation

Confirmed clean: "Sound Stages" has no separate hamburger entry (already fixed, comment in place explaining why), only one "Stages" entry exists. No new duplicates found.

## 12. Existing carousels

Real `Carousel` primitive usage confirmed in exactly the files expected (the three Studio rails + inline WorkHome collaborators carousel). Confirmed still grid/list: `StudioCardsGrid`, `CreditsSection`, `UnifiedWorkHistory`, `CreditVerificationPanel`, `ReviewsSection`, `WorkWithMeSection` — these are the real conversion targets for Phases 3 and 4.

## Components to merge

- `ProfileHero` + `PassportClaimHero` → one unified 3D Passport hero (Phase 1).

## Components to keep as-is (reused, not rebuilt)

- `HoloCard` (3D shell), all 10 Glass primitives, `SoundStagesRail`/`CastingCallsRail`/`RecentRecordingsRail` (Studio rails), evidence-gated labeling logic in `AchievementCard`/`CreditsSection`/`UnifiedWorkHistory`.

## Components to convert (grid/list → carousel or condensed surface)

- `CreditsSection` (Stamps), `CreditVerificationPanel` (Co-Sign evidence cards → 4-category carousels), `StudioCardsGrid` (Studio project cards → control-room layout).

## Components to remove *visually* (unmount, never delete data or files)

- `PassportOverview` — already unmounted in a prior phase, stays that way.
- The duplicate hero (`ProfileHero`'s standalone block once merged into the unified card) — exact scope decided during Phase 1 implementation, see that commit.

## Routes affected

`/profile` (own + public view), `/credits/mine`, `/desk`, `/desk/:projectId`, wherever `VoiceFirstCreateModal`/`CreateProjectWizard` are invoked (`WorkHome`, `QuickActionFab`, `WorkspaceSidebar`, `ProjectsList`).

## Data that must remain untouched

Credits, skills (existing entries — only additive `source` tagging), portfolio data, Co-Sign/endorsement records (`credit_endorsements`, `credit_vouches`), review/testimonial records (`reviews`, `review_requests` — kept functioning under a relabeled tab), visibility settings, verification status/timestamps. No table renamed, no column dropped, no row deleted. No migration in this phase.

## Rollback plan

Every phase lands as its own commit on `feature/creative-passport-rearchitecture` (never `main`), verified with `tsc`/`eslint`-diff/`build` before commit, matching this branch's established discipline. Any phase can be reverted independently with `git revert <commit>` without affecting the others, since components are being merged/converted in place rather than having their underlying data or routes restructured. Nothing in this plan requires a database migration, so there is no live-database rollback concern — the entire rollback surface is git history.
